Of course. A good README is essential for any project, even a small one. It explains what the code does, how to set it up, and how to use it.

Here is a comprehensive README file written in Markdown. You can create a new file named `README.md` in your project folder and paste this content into it.

# Google Docs Secret Message Decoder

This Python script decodes a secret message hidden within a public Google Document. It expects the document to contain a list of X and Y coordinates, each paired with a character. The script parses this data, reconstructs a 2D grid in memory, and prints the resulting message to the console.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer: Reliability

This script uses **HTML scraping** (`requests` and `BeautifulSoup`) to extract text from a Google Doc. This method is **extremely fragile and not recommended for reliable use**.

The HTML structure of a Google Docs page is complex, generated by JavaScript, and can **change at any time without warning**. A small update by Google could break this script completely.

For a robust and stable solution, you should use the **official [Google Docs API](https://developers.google.com/docs/api)**.

## How It Works

1.  **Fetches Content**: The script sends an HTTP GET request to the provided public Google Docs URL.
2.  **Parses HTML**: It uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the raw HTML of the page and extracts all visible text content.
3.  **Cleans Data**: It filters the extracted text to remove known headers (like "x-coordinate") and empty lines.
4.  **Parses Coordinates**: It iterates through the cleaned lines, expecting a repeating pattern of `x-coordinate`, `character`, `y-coordinate`.
5.  **Builds Grid**: It determines the required grid size from the maximum X and Y coordinates found in the data.
6.  **Populates Grid**: It places each character at its specified `[y][x]` position in the grid.
7.  **Prints Message**: It prints the final grid to the terminal, revealing the secret message.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6 or newer
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/secret-message-decoder.git
    cd secret-message-decoder
    ```

2.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Edit the Script**: Open the `decode_secret_message.py` file in a text editor.

2.  **Set the URL**: Near the bottom of the file, replace the placeholder URL with the link to your **public** Google Document. The document must be accessible to "Anyone with the link".

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # --- CHANGE THIS URL ---
        url = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/your_document_id_here/edit"
        decode_secret_message(url)
    ```

3.  **Run the script** from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```

The decoded message will be printed to your console.

## Required Google Docs Format

For the script to work correctly, the text inside the Google Doc must follow a strict format. The data should be organized as a continuous list of lines in the order: x-coordinate, character, then y-coordinate.

#### Example:

```
x-coordinate
y-coordinate
Character

0
H
0

2
l
0

3
l
0

4
o
0

6
W
1

7
o
1

8
r
1

9
l
1

10
d
1

1
e
0

```

## To-Do / Future Improvements

-   [ ] **Implement Google Docs API**: Replace the fragile HTML scraping method with the official Google Docs API for stability and reliability.
-   [ ] **Add Command-Line Arguments**: Allow the Google Docs URL to be passed as a command-line argument instead of being hardcoded in the script.
-   [ ] **Improve Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for malformed data or unexpected document formats.
